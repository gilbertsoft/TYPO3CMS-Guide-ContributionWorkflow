About This Guide
================

This guide provides all necessary information to enable you to contribute to the TYPO3 
source code. 

The main focus is submitting patches (to fix bugs or add new features) to the TYPO3 source 
code, but you will also find information for :ref:`writing bug reports <bugreporting-index>`, 
:ref:`adding documentation <Adding-documentation>`, :ref:`running tests <testing>`, 
:ref:`reviewing and testing patches <lifeOfAPatch>` etc.

How this guide is structured
============================

The guide is structured in a way to give you all necessary information **in the order
that you need it.** This means you can read it from the beginning and use it as a 
hands on guide, performing the steps as you go along. 

The further you go along, the more advanced the topics will become.

But, you can also use it as a reference guide and jump straight to a section you
are looking for. In this case, use the search box to search for what
you are looking for or browse through the menu. 

Some pages near the end of the manual assume that you are already familiar with 
contributing and serve as reference pages, for example the 
:ref:`git cheat sheet <cheat-sheet-git>`.

Some of the information, that is too extensive for the main guide, is found in 
the :ref:`appendix`.
